# TittaLSL
The TittaLSL tool is an extension to [Titta (and its TittaMex and TittaPy wrappers)](/readme.md#titta-tittamex-tittapy-classes). It allows to stream data from Tobii eye trackers in Titta's format using Lab Streaming Layer and to receive such data and access it through an API that is identical to that of Titta. That allows handling local and remote eye tracker data sources in a uniform manner, making it possible to design interesting experiments using multiple eye trackers.

TittaLSL is a C++ library that can be compiled and used as a static library without Matlab/Octave or Python. However, MATLAB and Python wrappers are also provided in the form of TittaLSLMex and TittaLSLPy, respectively.

In comparison to the the [Lab Streaming Layer TobiiPro Connector](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-TobiiPro), Titta LSL provides access to all gaze data fields instead of only gaze position on the screen, as well as the external signal, time synchronization and positioning streams. Samples are furthermore properly timestamped using the timestamps from the eye tracker, where possible (all streams except for the positioning stream, which doesn't have timestamps).

When using TittaLSL, please cite the following paper:
[Niehorster, D.C., Nystr√∂m, M. (2025). TittaLSL: A toolbox for creating networked eye-tracking experiments in Python and MATLAB with Tobii eye trackers. Behavior Research Methods. doi: 10.3758/s13428-025-02714-2](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02714-2)

## The `TittaLSL`, `TittaLSLMex` and `TittaLSLPy` classes
The functionality of TittaLSL is divided over two classes, `Sender` for making eye tracker data available on the network (AKA an outlet in Lab Streaming Layer terminology) and `Receiver` for recording from TittaLSL data streams available on the network (AKA an inlet). The below documents the available methods of these classes. The functionality below is exposed under the same names in MATLAB as `TittaLSL.Sender` and `TittaLSL.Receiver`, respectively. The same functionality is also available from `TittaLSLPy.Sender` and `TittaLSLPy.Receiver` instances, but in that case all function and property names as well as stream names use `snake_case` names instead of `camelCase`. In C++ all below functions and classes are in the `TittaLSL` namespace. See [here for example C++ code](/LSL_streamer/cppLSLTest/main.cpp) using the library, and [here for example Python code](/LSL_streamer/TittaLSLPy/test.py).

|Call|Inputs|Notes|
| --- | --- | --- |
|`TittaLSL::Sender()` (C++)<br>`TittaLSL.Sender()` (MATLAB)<br>`TittaLSLPy.Sender` (Python)|<ol><li>`address`: address of the eye tracker to be made available on the network. A list of connected eye trackers and their addresses can be using the static function [`Titta.findAllEyeTrackers()` in the Titta library](/readme.md#titta-tittamex-tittapy-classes).</li></ol>||
|`TittaLSL::Receiver()` (C++)<br>`TittaLSL.Receiver()` (MATLAB)<br>`TittaLSLPy.Receiver` (Python)|<ol><li>`streamSourceID`: Source ID of LSL stream to record from. Must be a TittaLSL stream.</li><li>`initialBufferSize`: (optional) value indicating for how many samples memory should be allocated.</li><li>`doStartRecording`: (optional) value indicating whether recording from the stream should immediately be started.</li></ol>|The default initial buffer size should cover about 30 minutes of recording gaze data at 600Hz, and longer for the other streams. Growth of the buffer should cause no performance impact at all as it happens on a separate thread. To be certain, you can indicate a buffer size that is sufficient for the number of samples that you expect to record. Note that all buffers are fully in-memory. As such, ensure that the computer has enough memory to satify your needs, or you risk a recording-destroying crash.|

The following method calls are available on a `TittaLSL.Sender` instance:

|Call|Inputs|Outputs|Description|

The following static calls are available for `TittaLSL.Receiver`:
|Call|Inputs|Outputs|Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`GetStreams()`|<ol><li>`stream`: (optional) string, possible values: `gaze`, `externalSignal`, `timeSync` and `positioning`. If provided, only streams of this type are discovered on the network.</li><li>`timeout`: double, duration for LSL to search for streams.

The following method calls are available on a `TittaLSL.Receiver` instance. Note that samples provided by the `consume*()` and `peek*()` functions are almost identical to those provided by their namesakes in `Titta` for a local eye tracker. The only difference is that the samples provided by TittaLSL have two extra fields, `remoteSystemTimeStamp` and `localSystemTimeStamp`. `remoteSystemTimeStamp` is the timestamp as provided by the Tobii SDK on the system where the eye tracker is connected. `localSystemTimeStamp` is the same timestamp, but expressed in the clock of the receiving machine. This local time is computed by using the offset provided by Lab Streaming Layer's `time_correction` function for the stream that the receiver is connected to. See [the Tobii SDK documentation](https://developer.tobiipro.com/commonconcepts.html) for a description of the other fields.

## Working on the source
The enclosed Visual Studio project files can be opened using the `Titta.sln` file in the [SDK_wrapper directory](/SDK_wrapper). It is to be opened and built with Visual Studio 2022 (last tested with version 17.8.4).

### Building the mex files
Run `makeTittaLSLMex.m` to build the mex file. You have to do this first if you want to use Titta from Octave, mex files for Octave are no longer bundled with Titta. However, it should be as simple as running that function once, since everything needed is contained in this repository. Mex files for MATLAB (Windows and Linux) are provided in this repository.

For building the Linux mex file the default gcc version 11.2.0 included with Ubuntu 22.04 was used.
For compatibility with an earlier version of Ubuntu, either install the right GLIBCXX version or recompile following the instructions here. See [this issue](https://github.com/dcnieho/Titta/issues/40) for more information.

### Required environment variables
Some environment variables must be set when working on the code or building it from Visual Studio. Here are the values i used (at the time of writing):
- `MATLAB_ROOT`: `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2023b`
- `PYTHON_ROOT`: `C:\Program Files\PsychoPy`

### Dependencies
#### [Lab Streaming Layer library](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl)
To update the Lab Streaming Layer library used to build TittaLSL against, you need to manually put the some files in the right place:
1. The \*.h include files are placed in `\LSL_streamer\deps\include`
2. The Windows `lsl.lib` link library is placed in `\LSL_streamer\deps\lib`.
3. The \*.dll, \*.so and \*.dylib files are placed in the output directory, `\LSL_streamer\TittaLSLMex\+TittaLSL\+detail`.
Note that if you want to update the Tobii SDK, you should perform that update first for the SDK_Wrapper. Only for step 3 do you need to place the updated `tobii_research_v2.dll` in the `\LSL_streamer\TittaLSLMex\+TittaLSL\+detail` folder.

#### [Titta](/SDK_wrapper)
TittaLSL also requires Titta and its dependencies to build. The build scripts are set up such that Titta is automatically built. However, ensure to check [Titta's dependencies](/SDK_wrapper/README.md#dependencies) and make sure they are available, or the build will fail.
